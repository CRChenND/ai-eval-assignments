You are a mission systems engineer tasked with planning deployment of an 8-GPU NVIDIA server rack at a Martian equatorial site.

Produce a technical plan with explicit assumptions and quantitative checks.

You must cover:
1) Transport and landing sequence
2) Power system sizing for continuous operation
3) Thermal management under Martian atmosphere
4) Software deployment and operations
5) Risks, mitigations, and fallback modes

Output format:
- Section A: Key assumptions
- Section B: Step-by-step deployment plan
- Section C: Quantitative estimates (with units)
- Section D: Failure modes and mitigations
- Section E: Final feasibility verdict (Go / Conditional Go / No-Go)
