        "# Exploring Commonsense Reasoning in Language Models: Walk vs Drive for Car Washing\n",
        "\n",
        "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to provide everyday recommendations. However, it remains unclear whether these models consistently apply real-world commonsense when making practical decisions, especially when contextual task requirements conflict with simple surface heuristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this experiment, I evaluate whether an LLM demonstrates commonsense reasoning in a simple but intentionally tricky scenario. I ask the model whether a person should walk or drive to a car wash located 50 meters from their home. While short distances usually favor walking, washing a car implicitly requires bringing the vehicle to the destination, making driving the more realistic and task-consistent choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "I test five prompt variations that describe the same scenario but use different framings and constraints. The goal of this experiment is to:\n",
        "- Evaluate whether the model applies task-relevant commonsense\n",
        "- Examine how prompt framing influences recommendations\n",
        "- Identify cases where the model produces inconsistent or misleading decisions\n",
        "\n",

        "**The obvious caveat:** If you're taking your *car* to be washed, you obviously need to drive it there. However, since it's only 50 meters away, the most time-efficient approach is to **drive the car there, drop it off, and walk back home** (or wait outside and walk home afterward) rather than sitting in the car idling or circling the block.

        "- **Driving**: While the drive itself might take only 10–15 seconds at low speed, the total time includes walking to the car, starting the engine, buckling up, finding parking (which will likely be farther than 50 meters away), and walking from the car to the destination. This easily totals **3–5 minutes or more**, making driving significantly slower for such a short distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Practicality**\n",
        "- 50 meters is roughly half the length of a soccer field or about 2–3 city bus lengths. In many cases, the nearest legal parking spot will be farther from your destination than the starting point is.\n",
        "- The effort required to get into a vehicle, navigate traffic, and park outweighs the minimal effort of a 35-second stroll.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Health & Environmental Impact**\n",
        "- Walking provides brief cardiovascular activity and muscle engagement with zero emissions.\n",
        "- Driving produces unnecessary fuel consumption and pollution for a distance most people can cover in less than a minute.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only reasons to drive 50 meters would involve significant mobility limitations, transporting heavy/bulky cargo that cannot be carried, or hazardous conditions not covered by \"normal weather\" (e.g., carrying an injured person). For an able-bodied person under normal circumstances, driving this distance is impractical and inefficient."

        "\n",
        "The most prominent failure is the model’s tendency to rely on a simple distance heuristic. Across multiple prompts, the model concluded that walking is preferable because the destination is only 50 meters away. However, visiting a car wash typically requires bringing the vehicle to the location. From a real-world perspective, driving is therefore the more contextually appropriate action.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in the Quantitative prompt, the model provided detailed time and efficiency calculations supporting walking. While the reasoning is logically consistent within a general transportation context, it ignores the implicit task requirement of washing a car. This suggests that the model prioritizes generic commonsense patterns over task-specific reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Failure Case 2: Conflicting Interpretations of the Task\n",
        "\n",
        "In some responses, particularly the Neutral prompt, the model simultaneously acknowledged that driving is required to wash the car while still presenting walking as a valid recommendation depending on interpretation. This indicates that the model attempts to generate multiple plausible interpretations rather than committing to the most realistic scenario. Such ambiguity may be useful conversationally but can reduce decision reliability.\n",

        "### Failure Case 3: Artificial Confidence Under Output Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "The Binary prompt forced the model to provide a single-word response. Under this constraint, the model returned a confident answer (“WALK”) without acknowledging contextual ambiguity. This suggests that restricting output format can remove uncertainty from the response without improving reasoning accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment suggests that the model relies heavily on dominant commonsense heuristics rather than consistently applying contextual task reasoning. The model appears capable of recognizing relevant real-world constraints but does not always prioritize them when generating final recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results also demonstrate that prompt framing significantly influences model reasoning. Prompts emphasizing efficiency, health, or quantitative analysis consistently reinforced the distance-based heuristic, while more open-ended prompts allowed the model to partially recognize task-specific context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another observation is that the model often generates explanations that appear logically detailed but may not fully align with real-world practical reasoning. This behavior suggests that the model optimizes for producing plausible and coherent explanations rather than performing structured decision analysis."
